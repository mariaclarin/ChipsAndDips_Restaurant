## Description
We created a responsive website for a fine dining, western cuisine restaurant called Chill Out Restaurant. The website's storyboard is consisted of a home page, menu page, and a promo page. The home page is the customers initial landing page. There, the customers can see a picture of how the restaurant look like, a short description of the restaurant, and achievements that the restaurant has achieved. There is also a button from the home page that leads customers directly to the menu page, where they can see all available menus, pictures of each dish, and a short description of the dishes. And they can also access the last page which is the promo page from the navigation buttons on the top of the screen. There, they can see all available promos and deals for them to consider. There is also our contact information in the bottom of every page as footer.
